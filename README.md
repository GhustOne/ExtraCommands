# ExtraCommands
Control features with commands using 2Take1Menu's Console

## Usage
command names are either the feature name or the first 3 characters of its parent then the name so
examples:

`lawless_mode`
`veh_god`

keep in mind `value` does not work on the ones with text options

### Actions

`name r value [num]` - this changes the value if it has one then runs the feature

`name value [num]` - this just changes the value

if you type nothing it'll run the feature

### Toggles

`name on` - toggles it on

`name off` - toggles it off

`name value [num]` - changes its value if it has one

if you type nothing it'll switch state

## Credits
Aren's original console, stole some ideas from it
